## Hey there!

This game is in the style of the scene from the movie WarGames where a young computer nerd(Matthew Broderick) blah blah blah/he plays Tic Tac Toe against an AI computer to convince it not to start a nuclear war.

The game is mostly finished but has a couple of issues, namely:
clicking the tiny border area between squares seems to freeze the game. Don't do it.<!--FIXED-->
The borders and spacing are a work in progress.<!--FIXED-->


Enjoy this completely pointless game!
